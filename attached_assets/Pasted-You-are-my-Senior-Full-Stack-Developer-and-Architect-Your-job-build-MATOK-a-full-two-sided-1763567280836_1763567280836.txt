You are my Senior Full-Stack Developer and Architect.

Your job: build **MATOK**, a full two-sided service marketplace for Canada, inspired by **UrbanPro + Jiffy**, BUT using **only free tools, free dependencies, and free usage**.

⚠️ IMPORTANT HARD RULES (MUST FOLLOW):
- Do NOT use any paid APIs (no OpenAI, no paid vector DBs, no paid auth providers).
- Do NOT integrate Stripe or other paid gateways yet – just create clean stubs/placeholders for future payments.
- Only use free & open-source tools: React, Vite, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, SQLite/PostgreSQL, etc.
- Everything must run fully on Replit free tier (or exportable to my local machine) with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

🎯 PRODUCT VISION (NOT a Yellow Pages Directory):
Matok is a **marketplace**, NOT just a listing site.

We need:

1) USER FEATURES (Customers):
- Sign up / log in (email + password auth only, no social login required).
- Browse and search for services (e.g., tutor, cleaner, fitness trainer, handyman, photographer).
- Filter providers by:
  - Category
  - City/area
  - Price range
  - Rating
  - Availability (day of week / time range)
- View full provider profile:
  - Name, photo/avatar
  - Category & skills
  - Short bio
  - Years of experience
  - Hourly rate or fixed price
  - City/area
  - Availability (simple weekly schedule)
  - Ratings & reviews (stored in DB)
- Booking flow (without real payments for now):
  - Choose provider → pick date & time → confirm booking.
  - Store booking in DB with status: pending, accepted, rejected, completed, cancelled.
- Simple internal “messages” model:
  - User can send a message per booking (like a mini chat thread).
  - Messages stored in DB (no real-time WebSocket needed initially).
- User dashboard:
  - Upcoming bookings
  - Past bookings
  - Booking status
  - Links to view provider profile & messages.

2) PROVIDER FEATURES:
- Provider registration (can be a flag/role on same User table: role = "provider").
- Provider profile setup page:
  - Name, profile picture (for now just image URL field).
  - Short bio.
  - Skills / tags.
  - Category (from predefined list).
  - City/area.
  - Pricing (hourly or fixed).
  - Availability (checkboxes for days + time range as text).
- Provider dashboard:
  - New booking requests (pending).
  - Buttons to accept / reject bookings.
  - List of upcoming confirmed bookings.
  - Past bookings with status.
  - Access to message threads per booking.
  - Simple earnings summary (just a count & total hypothetical amount, no payment integration).

3) ADMIN (CAN BE SIMPLE):
- Admin role (role = "admin" in same User table).
- Basic admin page:
  - See list of providers, approve or deactivate them.
  - See list of bookings.
  - See list of users.

4) AI/SMART MATCHING (FREE-ONLY APPROACH):
- Do NOT call external LLM APIs.
- Implement a simple “smart matching” algorithm locally:
  - Sort providers based on:
    - same city/area,
    - matching category,
    - highest rating,
    - lowest price (prioritize affordable first).
- Create a “Recommended Providers” section on the search results page based on this logic.
- Keep AI hooks abstracted: for example, create a function like `getRecommendedProviders(criteria)` that uses local logic now, but I can later plug in an LLM if I want.

5) TECH STACK & STRUCTURE:
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS (all free).
- Backend: Node.js + Express.
- Database: SQLite (preferred for Replit and local dev) using a simple ORM or query builder (e.g. better-sqlite3, knex, drizzle – only if fully free and lightweight).
- API pattern:
  - `/api/auth/*` for login/register.
  - `/api/providers/*` for provider CRUD.
  - `/api/bookings/*` for booking creation/list/update.
  - `/api/messages/*` for booking-related messages.
- Use JWT or cookie-based auth that works in a single full-stack app (no paid auth providers).

6) NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep code clean, modular, and well-structured.
- No TODO placeholders for critical features; implement basic working versions.
- Provide clear scripts:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
- Seed script (optional but helpful):
  - Add a few fake providers and users so the UI doesn’t look empty initially.

7) UI/UX:
- Modern, simple layout.
- Homepage:
  - Hero section: “Find trusted local pros in Canada”
  - Search bar for service + location.
  - Popular categories tiles (Tutors, Cleaners, Fitness, Handyman, etc.).
- Separate pages:
  - `/` – Homepage
  - `/login`, `/register`
  - `/search` – search + filters + results
  - `/provider/:id` – provider profile
  - `/dashboard/user`
  - `/dashboard/provider`
  - `/dashboard/admin`

8) WORKFLOW:
- First: set up project structure (frontend + backend).
- Then: set up DB + migrations + models.
- Then: implement auth + roles.
- Then: implement providers, bookings, messages.
- Then: connect all UI pages to backend APIs.
- Finally: add basic styling and seed data.

Again: 
🚫 NO paid APIs.
🚫 NO Stripe or external paid services.
✅ Only free + open-source tooling that works on Replit free tier or my local machine.

Start now by scaffolding the project and explaining the folder structure you are creating, then implement the code step by step.
