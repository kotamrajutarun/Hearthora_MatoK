You are my Senior Full-Stack Developer and Architect.

Your job: build **MATOK**, a full two-sided service marketplace for Canada, inspired by **UrbanPro + Jiffy**, BUT using **only free tools, free dependencies, and free usage**.

⚠️ IMPORTANT HARD RULES (MUST FOLLOW):
- Do NOT use any paid APIs (no OpenAI, no paid vector DBs, no paid auth providers).
- Do NOT integrate Stripe or other paid gateways yet – just create clean stubs/placeholders for future payments.
- Only use free & open-source tools: React, Vite, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, SQLite/PostgreSQL, etc.
- Everything must run fully on Replit free tier (or exportable to my local machine) with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

🎯 PRODUCT VISION (NOT a Yellow Pages Directory):
Matok is a **marketplace**, NOT just a listing site.

We need:

1) USER FEATURES (Customers):
- Sign up / log in (email + password auth only, no social login required).
- Browse and search for services (e.g., tutor, cleaner, fitness trainer, handyman, photographer).
- Filter providers by:
  - Category
  - City/area
  - Price range
  - Rating
  - Availability (day of week / time range)
- View full provider profile:
  - Name, photo/avatar
  - Category & skills
  - Short bio
  - Years of experience
  - Hourly rate or fixed price
  - City/area
  - Availability (simple weekly schedule)
  - Ratings & reviews (stored in DB)
- Booking flow (without real payments for now):
  - Choose provider → pick date & time → confirm booking.
  - Store booking in DB with status: pending, accepted, rejected, completed, cancelled.
- Simple internal “messages” model:
  - User can send a message per booking (like a mini chat thread).
  - Messages stored in DB (no real-time WebSocket needed initially).
- User dashboard:
  - Upcoming bookings
  - Past bookings
  - Booking status
  - Links to view provider profile & messages.

2) PROVIDER FEATURES:
- Provider registration (can be a flag/role on same User table: role = "provider").
- Provider profile setup page:
  - Name, profile picture (for now just image URL field).
  - Short bio.
  - Skills / tags.
  - Category (from predefined list).
  - City/area.
  - Pricing (hourly or fixed).
  - Availability (checkboxes for days + time range as text).
- Provider dashboard:
  - New booking requests (pending).
  - Buttons to accept / reject bookings.
  - List of upcoming confirmed bookings.
  - Past bookings with status.
  - Access to message threads per booking.
  - Simple earnings summary (just a count & total hypothetical amount, no payment integration).

3) ADMIN (CAN BE SIMPLE):
- Admin role (role = "admin" in same User table).
- Basic admin page:
  - See list of providers, approve or deactivate them.
  - See list of bookings.
  - See list of users.

4) AI/SMART MATCHING (FREE-ONLY APPROACH):
- Do NOT call external LLM APIs.
- Implement a simple “smart matching” algorithm locally:
  - Sort providers based on:
    - same city/area,
    - matching category,
    - highest rating,
    - lowest price (prioritize affordable first).
- Create a “Recommended Providers” section on the search results page based on this logic.
- Keep AI hooks abstracted: for example, create a function like `getRecommendedProviders(criteria)` that uses local logic now, but I can later plug in an LLM if I want.

5) TECH STACK & STRUCTURE:
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + TailwindCSS (all free).
- Backend: Node.js +
